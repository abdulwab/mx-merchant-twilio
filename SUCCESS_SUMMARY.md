## 🚀 How to Use

### Start the Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Create a Payment Link
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/payments/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 150.00,
    "invoice": {
      "number": "INV-001"
    },
    "customer": {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com"
    }
  }'
```

### Frontend Integration
```javascript
// In your frontend code
const response = await fetch('/api/payments/create', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    amount: 150.00,
    invoice: { number: 'INV-001' },
    customer: { 
      name: 'John Doe', 
      email: 'john@example.com' 
    }
  })
});

const data = await response.json();

if (data.success) {
  // Redirect customer to hosted payment page
  window.location.href = data.data.paymentUrl;
}
```

## 📦 What You Get

### Request Payload
```javascript
{
  amount: 150.00,
  currency: "USD", // optional, defaults to USD
  invoice: {
    number: "INV-2024-001",
    description: "Payment description" // optional
  },
  customer: {
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john@example.com",
    phone: "+1234567890" // optional
  },
  redirectUrl: "https://yoursite.com/success", // optional
  cancelUrl: "https://yoursite.com/cancel" // optional
}
```

### Response

{
  success: true,
  data: {
    paymentUrl: "https://pay.mxmerchant.com/Link2Pay/[UDID]?Amt=150.00&...",
    amount: 150,
    currency: "USD",
    invoice: { ... },
    customer: { ... },
    message: "Redirect customer to paymentUrl to complete payment"
  }
}
```

## 🔐 Security Features

✅ **PCI Compliant** - Never handle card data  
✅ **Secure Authentication** - Basic Auth with API credentials  
✅ **HTTPS** - All communications encrypted  
✅ **Hosted Page** - MX Merchant handles payment processing  
✅ **No Card Storage** - Card details never touch your server  

## 📊 Technical Details

### Architecture
```
Your App → Your API → MX Merchant API → Link2Pay Device
                                        ↓
Customer → Payment URL → MX Hosted Page → Process Payment
                                        ↓
                      Customer Redirected Back to Your Site
```

### What Happens Behind the Scenes
1. First request creates a Link2Pay device (cached)
2. Subsequent requests use the cached device UDID
3. Payment URL constructed with query parameters
4. Customer redirected to MX hosted page
5. After payment, customer redirected back to your URLs

### Performance
- Link2Pay device cached for reuse
- Instant payment URL generation
- No database required
- Minimal API calls

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Test Script
```bash
npm run test:payment
```

### Manual Testing
1. Start server: `npm run dev`
2. Create payment link via API
3. Copy `paymentUrl` from response
4. Open in browser to see hosted payment page
